# Performance Optimization Notes

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Voice Notes AI application.

## Coroutine Dispatchers

### Implementation
- Created `DispatcherModule` to provide properly scoped coroutine dispatchers
- Added `@IoDispatcher`, `@DefaultDispatcher`, and `@MainDispatcher` qualifiers
- All I/O operations (network, database, DataStore) now run on `Dispatchers.IO`
- UI updates remain on `Dispatchers.Main` (default for ViewModels)

### Benefits
- Prevents blocking the main thread during I/O operations
- Ensures UI remains responsive during:
  - API calls to AI services
  - Database operations (saving/loading notes)
  - DataStore operations (settings)
- Proper thread pool management for concurrent operations

## Memory Leak Prevention

### Audio Resource Cleanup
- Implemented `release()` method in `AudioRepository` and `AudioRepositoryImpl`
- Added `cleanup()` method in `RecordVoiceUseCase`
- `MainViewModel.onCleared()` calls cleanup to release SpeechRecognizer resources
- Prevents memory leaks when the ViewModel is destroyed

### ViewModel Scoping
- All coroutines are launched in `viewModelScope`
- Automatically cancelled when ViewModel is cleared
- Prevents leaked coroutines and callbacks

## Network Optimization

### Timeout Configuration
- 30-second timeout for all AI API calls using `withTimeout()`
- Prevents indefinite waiting on slow/unresponsive servers
- Provides better user experience with timely error messages

### Dispatcher Usage
- All network calls run on `Dispatchers.IO`
- Proper error handling for network failures
- Efficient thread pool usage for concurrent requests

## Database Optimization

### Flow-based Reactive Updates
- Notes list uses `Flow<List<Note>>` for reactive updates
- Automatic UI updates when data changes
- No manual refresh needed
- Efficient database queries with Room

### Dispatcher Usage
- All database operations run on `Dispatchers.IO`
- Prevents blocking the main thread during CRUD operations
- Room's built-in query optimization

## DataStore Optimization

### Encrypted Storage
- Settings stored using encrypted DataStore
- Secure and performant key-value storage
- Flow-based reactive reads

### Dispatcher Usage
- All DataStore operations run on `Dispatchers.IO`
- Non-blocking reads and writes
- Efficient preference management

## UI Responsiveness

### State Management
- ViewModels use `StateFlow` for UI state
- Compose automatically recomposes only when state changes
- Efficient UI updates without unnecessary recompositions

### Background Processing
- Recording, transcription, and AI generation all run in background
- UI shows loading indicators during processing
- User can navigate away without interrupting operations

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Structured Concurrency**: All coroutines properly scoped to lifecycle
2. **Proper Threading**: I/O operations never block the main thread
3. **Resource Cleanup**: All resources properly released when no longer needed
4. **Timeout Handling**: Network operations have reasonable timeouts
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
6. **Memory Efficiency**: No leaked resources or coroutines

## Performance Monitoring Recommendations

For production, consider adding:
- Performance monitoring (Firebase Performance, etc.)
- Network request logging and analytics
- Memory leak detection tools (LeakCanary)
- Crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics, etc.)
- API response time tracking
