 *    - Custom provider setup with headers
 *    - Fallback mechanisms
 * 
 * 3. **Offline Functionality**: Offline-first architecture testing
 *    - Offline recording and storage
 *    - Sync queue management
 *    - Conflict resolution
 *    - Local AI processing
 *    - Storage management
 *

 * 
 * Each test class focuses on a specific integration area while ensuring
 * comprehensive coverage of all user workflows and system interactions.
 * 
 * Test Execution:
 * - Run individual test classes for focused testing
 * - Run the entire suite for comprehensive integration validation
 * - All tests use mocking to isolate integration logic from external dependencies
 * 
 * Coverage Areas:
 * - Happy path scenarios for all major workflows
 * - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
 * - Edge cases and boundary conditions
 * - Performance considerations (storage limits, retry logic)
 * - Security aspects (encryption, temporary sharing)

         * Test execution summary and guidelines.
         * 
         * This integration test suite validates the following key scenarios:
         * 
         * ## Recording to Task Management Workflow
         * - Complete end-to-end user journey from audio recording to task completion
         * - AI processing pipeline with enhancement and task extraction
         * - Error handling when AI processing fails
         * - Fallback to basic transcription when enhancement is unavailable
         * - Task extraction from various content formats
         * - Task completion updates across the system
         * 
         * ## AI Provider Configuration and Switching
         * - Switching between cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, OpenRouter)
         * - Local AI provider setup (Ollama, LM Studio)
         * - Custom provider configuration with headers and authentication
         * - Configuration validation and error handling
         * - Persistence of configurations across app restarts
         * - Fallback mechanisms when providers fail
         * - Rapid provider switching scenarios
         * - Network connectivity issues during validation
         * 
         * ## Offline Functionality and Sync
         * - Offline recording and local storage
         * - Operation queuing for later synchronization
         * - Sync processing when connectivity returns
         * - Local AI processing with Ollama/LM Studio
         * - Conflict resolution between local and remote changes
         * - Offline mode indicators and status messages
         * - Retry logic with exponential backoff
         * - Storage management with limited space
         * - Offline search capabilities
         * 
         * ## Export and Sharing Integration
         * - Single note export to PDF, Word, Markdown, Plain Text
         * - Bulk export operations with multiple notes
         * - Custom template support for exports
         * - Email sharing with attachments
         * - Cloud storage integration (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud)
         * - Calendar event creation from meeting notes
         * - Filtered exports with date ranges and categories
         * - Error handling for export failures
         * - Temporary sharing with expiration links
         * - Security features (password protection, download restrictions)
         * 
         * ## Test Execution Guidelines
         * 
         * ### Running Individual Test Classes:
         * ```bash
         * ./gradlew test --tests "com.voicenotesai.integration.RecordingToTaskWorkflowIntegrationTest"
         * ./gradlew test --tests "com.voicenotesai.integration.AIProviderSwitchingIntegrationTest"
         * ./gradlew test --tests "com.voicenotesai.integration.OfflineFunctionalityIntegrationTest"
         * ./gradlew test --tests "com.voicenotesai.integration.ExportSharingIntegrationTest"
         * ```
         * 
         * ### Running the Complete Suite:
         * ```bash
         * ./gradlew test --tests "com.voicenotesai.integration.IntegrationTestSuite"
         * ```
         * 
         * ### Running All Integration Tests:
         * ```bash
         * ./gradlew test --tests "com.voicenotesai.integration.*"
         * ```
         * 
         * ## Test Environment Setup
         * 
         * These integration tests use MockK for mocking external dependencies:
         * - Database operations are mocked to focus on integration logic
         * - Network calls are mocked to test various response scenarios
         * - File system operations are mocked for export/import testing
         * - AI provider APIs are mocked to test configuration scenarios
         * 
         * ## Expected Outcomes
         * 
         * All tests should pass, demonstrating that:
         * - User workflows complete successfully end-to-end
         * - AI provider switching works reliably with proper validation
         * - Offline functionality maintains data integrity and syncs correctly
         * - Export and sharing features work across all supported formats
         * - Error scenarios are handled gracefully with appropriate user feedback
         * - System maintains performance and reliability under various conditions
         * 
         * ## Troubleshooting
         * 
         * If tests fail:
         * 1. Check that all required dependencies are properly mocked
         * 2. Verify that test data matches expected formats
         * 3. Ensure coroutine test scope is properly configured
         * 4. Check for timing issues in async operations
         * 5. Validate that mock expectations match actual implementation calls
