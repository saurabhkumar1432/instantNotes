## Mock Framework

The performance tests use comprehensive mock implementations:

- **MockAnimationEngine**: Simulates UI animation rendering
- **MockDataManager**: Simulates data operations and memory usage
- **MockApplication**: Simulates app startup and initialization
- **MockDeviceSimulator**: Simulates different device configurations
- **MockScrollSimulator**: Simulates scrolling behavior and performance
- **MockDatabase**: Simulates database operations and queries

## Performance Metrics

### Collected Metrics
- Average execution time
- P95 and P99 percentiles
- Standard deviation
- Memory usage (before/after)
- Frame rates and dropped frames
- Throughput measurements

### Scoring System
- **90-100**: Excellent performance
- **80-89**: Good performance
- **70-79**: Acceptable performance
- **60-69**: Poor performance (needs optimization)
- **<60**: Unacceptable performance (critical issues)

## Continuous Integration

The performance tests are designed for CI/CD integration:

- **Quick Check**: Essential performance validation (5-10 minutes)
- **Full Suite**: Comprehensive testing (15-30 minutes)
- **Benchmark**: Detailed performance profiling (30-60 minutes)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Memory Tests Failing**
   - Ensure sufficient heap space (`-Xmx2g`)
   - Run garbage collection between tests
   - Check for memory leaks in test setup

2. **Animation Tests Inconsistent**
   - Run on consistent hardware
   - Disable other applications during testing
   - Use dedicated test environment

3. **Startup Tests Slow**
   - Clear application data between tests
   - Ensure clean test environment
   - Check for background processes

### Performance Debugging

1. Enable detailed metrics: `-Dperformance.detailed.metrics=true`
2. Increase test iterations: `-Dperformance.test.iterations=20`
3. Use benchmark mode: `-Dperformance.benchmark.mode=true`

## Reporting

Performance test results are generated in multiple formats:

- **Console Output**: Real-time test progress and results
- **JUnit XML**: Standard test reporting format
- **HTML Reports**: Detailed test execution reports
- **Markdown Summary**: Human-readable performance summary

Reports are saved to `build/reports/performance/` directory.

## Contributing

When adding new performance tests:

1. Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Use the `PerformanceUtils` for consistent measurements
3. Include appropriate thresholds and validation
4. Add comprehensive documentation
5. Update this README with new test coverage
