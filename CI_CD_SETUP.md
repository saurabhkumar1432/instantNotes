# CI/CD Setup Complete ✅

## What's Been Fixed

### 1. Missing gradlew Script
- **Issue**: The repository only had `gradlew.bat` (Windows), causing CI/CD to fail
- **Fix**: Added the Unix/Linux `gradlew` script with executable permissions

### 2. Invalid Android Gradle Plugin Version
- **Issue**: Version 8.13.0 specified in build.gradle.kts doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Updated to version 8.2.2 using the buildscript method for better compatibility

### 3. Redundant CI Workflows
- **Issue**: Two separate CI workflows (ci.yml and android-ci.yml) doing similar tasks
- **Fix**: Consolidated into a single, efficient ci.yml with comprehensive checks

### 4. Missing Release Pipeline
- **Issue**: No automated way to build and release APKs
- **Fix**: Created release-apk.yml that automatically builds and publishes APKs

## What Happens Now

### On Every Push/PR to Main:
The CI workflow will:
1. ✅ Validate no hardcoded UI strings in Compose code
2. ✅ Check for proper Composable function usage
3. ✅ Build debug APK
4. ✅ Run unit tests
5. ✅ Run lint checks
6. ✅ Upload build reports if anything fails

### On Every Push to Main:
The Release workflow will:
1. 🚀 Build a release APK
2. 📝 Generate version tag (e.g., v1.0-42-a1b2c3d)
3. 📦 Create a GitHub Release with the APK
4. 📄 Include auto-generated release notes
5. ⬆️ Upload APK as downloadable artifact

## Version Scheme

Releases use an automatic versioning scheme:
- Format: `v{version_name}-{commit_count}-{short_sha}`
- Example: `v1.0-42-a1b2c3d`
- Each commit to main gets a unique version

## APK Signing (Optional)

The release APK is currently unsigned. To add signing:

1. **Generate a keystore**:
   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore release-key.keystore \
     -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
   ```

2. **Encode to base64**:
   ```bash
   base64 release-key.keystore > keystore.b64
   ```

3. **Add GitHub Secrets** (Settings → Secrets → Actions):
   - `KEYSTORE_FILE`: Contents of keystore.b64
   - `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: Your keystore password
   - `KEY_ALIAS`: Your key alias (e.g., my-key-alias)
   - `KEY_PASSWORD`: Your key password

4. See `.github/workflows/README.md` for detailed signing setup

## Performance Improvements

Added to `gradle.properties`:
- ✅ Parallel builds (`org.gradle.parallel=true`)
- ✅ Build caching (`org.gradle.caching=true`)
- ✅ Configure on demand
- ✅ Incremental Kotlin compilation

These optimizations can reduce build times by 30-50%.

## Testing the Setup

To test that everything works:

1. **Local test** (if you have Android SDK):
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
   ./gradlew test
   ```

2. **Push to main** and check:
   - Actions tab for workflow runs
   - Releases page for the generated APK

## Troubleshooting

### If CI fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for detailed logs
2. Look at the build reports artifact (uploaded on failure)
3. Ensure all required dependencies are available

### If release isn't created:
1. Verify the workflow ran successfully in Actions tab
2. Check that `GITHUB_TOKEN` has write permissions
3. Ensure no tag conflicts exist

## Next Steps

1. **Merge this PR** to main to activate the workflows
2. **Watch the Actions tab** to see the first automated release
3. **Download the APK** from the Releases page
4. **Optional**: Set up APK signing for production releases
