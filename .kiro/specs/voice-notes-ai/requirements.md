# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a simple Android application that converts voice input into AI-generated bullet-point notes. The app focuses on a single core functionality: recording voice, processing it through an AI service, and displaying formatted notes. Users can configure their preferred AI provider, API key, and model through a settings screen.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Voice Recording

**User Story:** As a user, I want to record my voice input, so that I can capture my thoughts and ideas hands-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display a prominent record button on the main screen
2. WHEN the user taps the record button THEN the system SHALL request microphone permission if not already granted
3. WHEN microphone permission is denied THEN the system SHALL display an error message explaining that microphone access is required
4. WHEN the user taps the record button AND permission is granted THEN the system SHALL start recording audio and provide visual feedback (e.g., animated recording indicator)
5. WHEN the user is recording THEN the system SHALL display a stop button to end the recording
6. WHEN the user taps the stop button THEN the system SHALL stop recording and process the audio
7. WHEN recording is in progress THEN the system SHALL display the recording duration
8. IF the recording exceeds 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL automatically stop recording and notify the user

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered Note Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want my voice recording to be converted into organized bullet-point notes using AI, so that I can quickly review and use my captured thoughts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user stops recording THEN the system SHALL convert the audio to text using speech-to-text
2. WHEN the audio is converted to text THEN the system SHALL send the text to the configured AI provider with a prompt to generate bullet-point notes
3. WHEN the AI processes the text THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
4. WHEN the AI returns the formatted notes THEN the system SHALL display them in a readable format on the screen
5. WHEN the AI returns the formatted notes THEN the system SHALL automatically save them to local storage with a timestamp
6. IF the AI request fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with the reason (e.g., invalid API key, network error, quota exceeded)
7. IF no AI provider is configured THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to configure settings before processing
8. WHEN notes are generated THEN the system SHALL allow the user to copy the notes to clipboard
9. WHEN notes are generated THEN the system SHALL allow the user to share the notes via other apps

### Requirement 3: Settings Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure my AI provider settings, so that I can use my preferred AI service and API credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the settings screen THEN the system SHALL display fields for AI provider selection, API key input, and model name input
2. WHEN the user selects an AI provider THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown or selection list with supported providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI)
3. WHEN the user enters an API key THEN the system SHALL mask the key for security (show as dots or asterisks)
4. WHEN the user enters a model name THEN the system SHALL accept text input for the model identifier
5. WHEN the user saves settings THEN the system SHALL validate that all required fields are filled
6. WHEN settings are saved successfully THEN the system SHALL store them securely using encrypted shared preferences
7. WHEN the user navigates to settings THEN the system SHALL display currently saved values (with masked API key)
8. IF settings are not configured THEN the system SHALL show a prompt on the main screen directing users to settings

### Requirement 4: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and intuitive interface, so that I can easily use the app without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display a simple, uncluttered main screen with the record button as the primary action
2. WHEN the app is in any state THEN the system SHALL provide a way to access the settings screen (e.g., settings icon in toolbar)
3. WHEN the user performs any action THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
5. WHEN the app is processing THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate actions (e.g., disable record button while processing)
6. WHEN notes are displayed THEN the system SHALL use a readable font size and proper spacing
7. WHEN the user rotates the device THEN the system SHALL preserve the current state (recording, notes, etc.)

### Requirement 5: Notes History and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and manage my previously generated notes, so that I can reference them later and keep my notes organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the notes section THEN the system SHALL display a list of all saved notes in reverse chronological order (newest first)
2. WHEN displaying notes in the list THEN the system SHALL show the timestamp and a preview of the first few lines
3. WHEN the user taps on a note THEN the system SHALL display the full note content
4. WHEN viewing a note THEN the system SHALL provide options to copy, share, or delete the note
5. WHEN the user deletes a note THEN the system SHALL remove it from storage and update the list
6. WHEN there are no saved notes THEN the system SHALL display an empty state message
7. WHEN notes are saved THEN the system SHALL persist them locally using a database
8. WHEN the app is reopened THEN the system SHALL load and display all previously saved notes

### Requirement 6: Permissions and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be handled securely, so that my privacy is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app first requests microphone access THEN the system SHALL explain why the permission is needed
2. WHEN the user denies permission THEN the system SHALL provide a way to open app settings to grant permission manually
3. WHEN audio is recorded THEN the system SHALL not store the audio file permanently after processing
4. WHEN API credentials are stored THEN the system SHALL use Android's encrypted storage mechanisms
5. WHEN the app sends data to AI providers THEN the system SHALL only send the transcribed text, not the raw audio
6. WHEN the app is uninstalled THEN the system SHALL ensure all stored credentials are removed
7. WHEN notes are stored THEN the system SHALL keep them in local device storage only
