# Recording Glitch Fix - Critical Issues Resolved

## Date: October 6, 2025 - **FINAL FIX**

## Problem Description
The recording functionality was experiencing **SEVERE glitching**:
- **Constant stuttering and glitching** from the moment recording starts
- **UI freezing** or severe lag
- **Errors thrown** after a short period
- **Inconsistent recording states**
- **Audio feedback issues**

## Root Causes Identified - COMPLETE ANALYSIS

### 1. **onRmsChanged() High-Frequency Callback** ⚠️ CRITICAL - PRIMARY CULPRIT
**Issue**: The `onRmsChanged()` callback is invoked by Android **40-100 times per second** during recording. Each invocation was attempting to send state updates through the Flow, creating massive backpressure.

**Problem Code**:
```kotlin
override fun onRmsChanged(rmsdB: Float) {
    if (isCurrentlyRecording && !stopRequested) {
        val now = System.currentTimeMillis()
        val duration = now - recordingStartTime
        
        if (now - lastDurationUpdate >= 100) {
            lastDurationUpdate = now
            trySend(RecordingState.Recording(duration)) // Still 10/sec!
        }
    }
}
```

**Even with 100ms throttling, this was still overwhelming the system!**

**Final Fix**: **Completely disabled onRmsChanged() updates** and moved duration tracking to a separate coroutine:
```kotlin
override fun onRmsChanged(rmsdB: Float) {
    // Intentionally empty - we use a separate coroutine for duration updates
    // to avoid glitching from the high frequency of this callback
}

// New approach: Independent coroutine
val durationJob = launch {
    while (isCurrentlyRecording && !stopRequested) {
        val duration = System.currentTimeMillis() - recordingStartTime
        trySend(RecordingState.Recording(duration))
        kotlinx.coroutines.delay(500) // Update every 500ms - smooth and lag-free
    }
}
```

### 2. **Partial Results Causing Additional Callbacks** ⚠️ HIGH IMPACT
**Issue**: `EXTRA_PARTIAL_RESULTS = true` causes the SpeechRecognizer to fire `onPartialResults()` frequently, adding more callbacks and processing overhead.

**Problem Code**:
```kotlin
putExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_PARTIAL_RESULTS, true) // Causes glitching!
```

**Fix**: Disabled partial results entirely:
```kotlin
putExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_PARTIAL_RESULTS, false) // Much smoother!
```

### 3. **Aggressive Timeout Values** ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Issue**: 2-second silence timeout was too aggressive, causing the recognizer to work harder to detect speech continuously.

**Fix**: Increased to 3 seconds for more relaxed recognition:
```kotlin
putExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_SPEECH_INPUT_COMPLETE_SILENCE_LENGTH_MILLIS, 3000L)
putExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_SPEECH_INPUT_POSSIBLY_COMPLETE_SILENCE_LENGTH_MILLIS, 3000L)
```

### 3. **Improper Error Handling on Manual Stop** ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Issue**: When user manually stopped recording, the SpeechRecognizer would fire `onError()` with `ERROR_CLIENT`, treating it as a failure instead of a successful stop.

**Problem Code**:
```kotlin
override fun onError(error: Int) {
    // Always treated as error, even on manual stop
    trySend(RecordingState.Error(errorMessage))
}
```

**Fix**: Check `stopRequested` flag before processing errors:
```kotlin
override fun onError(error: Int) {
    // Don't process errors if we manually stopped
    if (stopRequested) {
        isCurrentlyRecording = false
        return
    }
    
    // Now handle actual errors
    trySend(RecordingState.Error(errorMessage))
}
```

### 4. **Race Condition in stopRecording()** ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Issue**: Attempting to set StateFlow value and stop listener simultaneously created timing issues.

**Problem Code**:
```kotlin
override suspend fun stopRecording(): Result<String> {
    stopRequested.value = true  // Async update
    Result.success("Stop recording triggered")
}
```

**Fix**: Set boolean flag, add small delay, then stop:
```kotlin
override suspend fun stopRecording(): Result<String> {
    // Set flag first to prevent error callbacks
    stopRequested = true
    
    // Give the recognizer a moment to finish processing
    kotlinx.coroutines.delay(100)
    
    // Now stop the recognizer
    try {
        speechRecognizer?.stopListening()
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        speechRecognizer?.cancel()
    }
    
    Result.success("Stop recording triggered")
}
```

### 5. **Missing Check in onEndOfSpeech()** ⚠️ LOW
**Issue**: `onEndOfSpeech()` would send Processing state even when user manually stopped.

**Fix**: Added `stopRequested` check:
```kotlin
override fun onEndOfSpeech() {
    if (!stopRequested) {
        isCurrentlyRecording = false
        trySend(RecordingState.Processing)
    }
}
```

### 6. **Incomplete Cleanup Initialization** ⚠️ LOW
**Issue**: `cleanup()` wasn't being called before starting new recording, potentially leaving stale state.

**Fix**: Always call `cleanup()` before initializing:
```kotlin
// Clean up any existing recognizer
cleanup()
stopRequested = false
hasReceivedSpeech = false

speechRecognizer = SpeechRecognizer.createSpeechRecognizer(context)
```

## Improvements Made

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Reduced state updates from 10-50/sec to 10/sec** (100ms throttling)
2. **Eliminated unnecessary Flow collection** (removed StateFlow coroutine)
3. **Faster stop response** with direct flag checking

### Reliability Improvements
1. **Proper cleanup before each recording session**
2. **Better error discrimination** (manual stop vs actual errors)
3. **Enhanced error messages** with context about speech detection
4. **Fallback to cancel()** if stopListening() fails

### User Experience
1. **Smoother UI updates** during recording
2. **No more false error messages** on manual stop
3. **Better feedback** on timeout vs no-speech scenarios
4. **More stable recording** without glitches

## Technical Implementation - FINAL VERSION

### Architecture Changes

**Before (Problematic)**:
```
SpeechRecognizer callbacks → onRmsChanged (40-100/sec)
                           ↓
                    trySend() to Flow (10/sec throttled)
                           ↓
                    Flow buffer fills up
                           ↓
                    Backpressure → Glitching
```

**After (Smooth)**:
```
SpeechRecognizer callbacks → onRmsChanged (ignored, empty function)
                           
Independent coroutine → delay(500ms) → trySend() to Flow (2/sec)
                     ↓
              No backpressure → Smooth operation
```

### Key Changes Summary

1. **onRmsChanged()**: Now completely empty (no operations)
2. **Duration tracking**: Moved to independent coroutine with 500ms interval
3. **Partial results**: Disabled (`EXTRA_PARTIAL_RESULTS = false`)
4. **Silence timeout**: Increased from 2s to 3s
5. **Job management**: Duration job properly cancelled in `awaitClose`

### Code Structure
```kotlin
val durationJob = launch {
    while (isCurrentlyRecording && !stopRequested) {
        try {
            val duration = System.currentTimeMillis() - recordingStartTime
            
            // Check max duration
            if (duration >= maxRecordingDuration) {
                speechRecognizer?.stopListening()
                trySend(RecordingState.Error("Maximum duration reached"))
                break
            }
            
            // Send smooth update
            trySend(RecordingState.Recording(duration))
            delay(500) // Smooth 2 updates/sec
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            break // Flow closed
        }
    }
}

awaitClose {
    durationJob.cancel() // Clean cancellation
    cleanup()
}
```
